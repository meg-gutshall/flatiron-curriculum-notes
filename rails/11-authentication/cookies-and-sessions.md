# Lesson: Cookies and Sessions

Cookies are a way for an HTTP server to ask the user's browser to store a little bit of data for it, and then get that data back from the browser later.

They are fundamental to the operation of nearly every contemporary website.

Primarily, cookies are used for login. They provide a way for us to verify who a user is once, and then remember it for their entire session. Without cookies, you would have to provide your username and password on every single request to the server. Cookies may also be used to store other information about a user, such as what's in their shopping cart, or what ads you've shown them during their visit.

In this document, we'll cover what cookies are, how they fit into the HTTP response flow, and how you can access them within your Rails application.

## Shopping

Let's say we want to build an e-commerce site. Users can come to the site, add some items to their shopping cart, and then pay for all of them at the end. Simple. Where does the shopping cart live?

We could create a `Cart` model, which `has_and_belongs_to_many` `Item`s. But that leaves a fundamental problem: how do we know what cart to load when we get a request? When one user requests to see their cart, how can I tell them apart from another user, and make sure they're seeing the right cart?

The flow looks like this:

- When a user adds something to their cart, their browser will make a `POST` request to `/cart`.
- Later, to see the content of their cart, they'll send a `GET` request to `/cart`.

Remember what's included in an HTTP request:

- an HTTP verb, like `GET`, `POST`, or `PATCH`
- a path
- various headers

HTTP servers are typically stateless. They receive requests, process them, return data, then forget about them.

For example, `GET` requests usually encode this information in the path. When you write a route matching `/items/:item_id`, you are telling Rails to pull the value `id` from the request path and save it in `params[:id]`. In your `items_controller`, you'll probably have a method that looks something like:

```ruby
def show
  @item = Item.find(params[:item_id])
end
```

Which loads the row for that item from the database and returns it as an Active Record model object, which your `show.html.erb` then renders. If we want to be able to retrieve the current cart, we need to have its `id` somewhere in the HTTP request. Specifically, it must be in the path or the headers.

It would be possible, though quite convoluted, to store this information in the path. This would have strange effects: since the path is shown in the browser's URL bar, a user who copies a URL and sends it to a friend would also be copying their shopping cart ID. Upon loading the page, the friend would see what's in the user's cart. Since a cart is owned by a particular user, and may contain private information, this is probably not what we want. Cookies allow us to store this information in the only other place available to us: HTTP headers.

## What's A Cookie Anyway

Let's see what [the spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) has to say:

```html
This section outlines a way for an origin server to send state
information to a user agent and for the user agent to return the
state information to the origin server.

To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
HTTP response. In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a
Cookie request header to the origin server. The Cookie header
contains cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie
headers. The origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or
use its contents for an application-defined purpose.
```

The description is quite technical, so let's look at their example:

```html
== Server -> User Agent ==
Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

== User Agent -> Server ==
Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42
```

In this example, the server is an HTTP server, and the User Agent is a browser. The server responds to a request with the `Set-Cookie` header. The header sets the value of the `SID` cookie to `31d4d96e407aad42`.

Next, when the user visits another page on the same server, the browser sends the cookie back to the server, including the `Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42` header in its request.

Cookies are stored in the browser. The browser doesn't care about what's in the cookies you set. It just stores the data and sends it along on future requests to your server. You can think of them as a hash—and indeed, as we'll see later, Rails exposes cookies with a method that behaves much like a hash.

## Using Cookies

So how would we use a cookie to store a reference to the user's shopping cart? Let's say that we create a cart the first time a user adds something to their cart. Then, in the response, we might include the header:

```html
== Server -> User Agent ==
Set-Cookie: cart_id=273
```

Only with the `cart.id` of the cart we just saved.

When the user comes back to our site, their browser will include the cookie in their reply:

```html
== User Agent -> Server ==
Cookie: cart_id=273
```

We can look at this HTTP header, get the `cart_id` from it, and look it up using the Active Record find method we know and love.

## Security Concerns

Cookies are stored as plain text in a user's browser. Therefore, the user can see what's in them, and they can set them to anything they want.

If you open the developer console in your browser, you can see the cookies set by the current site. In Chrome's console, you can find this under `Resources > Cookies`. You can delete any cookie you like. For example, if you delete you `user_session` cookie on `github.com`, you will find that you've been logged out. You can also edit cookies, for example with [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en).

This presents a problem for us. If users can edit their `cart_id` cookie, then they can see other users' shopping carts.

## Rails to the Rescue

Fortunately, Rails has a solution to this. When you set cookies in Rails, you usually don't manipulate the HTTP headers directly. Instead, you use the `session` method. The `session` method is available anywhere in the Rails response cycle, and it behaves like a hash:

```ruby
# set cart_id
session[:cart_id] = @cart.id

# load the cart referenced in the session
@ cart = session[:cart_id]
```

You can store any simple Ruby object in the session. In fact, we don't need a `Cart` model at all—we can just store a list of items in the session!

Rails manages all session data in a single cookie, named `_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME_session`. It _serializes_ all the key/value pairs you set with `session`, converting them from a Ruby object into a big string. Whenever you set a `key` with the `session` method, Rails updates the value of its session cookie to this big string.

When you set cookies this way, Rails signs them to prevent users from tampering with them. Your Rails server has a key, configured in `config/secrets.yml`.

```yml
# config/secrets.yml

development:
  secret_key_base: secret  # not a secure key, just an example
```

Somewhere else, Rails has a method, let's call it `sign`, which takes a `message` and a `key` and returns a `signature`, which is just a string:

```ruby
# sign(message: string, key:string) -> signature: string

def sign(message, key)
  # cryptographic magic here
  return signature
end
```

It's guaranteed that given the same message and key, sign will produce the same output. Also, without the key, it is practically impossible to know what `sign` would return for a given message. That is, signatures can't be forged.

Rails creates a signature for every cookie it sets, and appends the signature to the cookie. When it receives a cookie, Rails verifies that the signature matches the content (that is, that `sign(cookie_body, secret_key_base) == cookie_signature`). This prevents cookie tampering. If a user tries to edit their cookie and change the `cart_id`, the signature won't match, and Rails will silently ignore the cookie and set a new one.

Cryptography is a deep rabbit hole. At this point, you don't need to worry about the specifics of how cryptography works, just that Rails and other frameworks use it to ensure that session data which is set on the server can't be edited by users.

## Tying It Together

In our `items_controller.rb`, we might have an `add_to_cart` method, which is called when the user adds something to their cart. It might work something like this:

```ruby
# Routed from POST /items/:id/add_to_cart
def add_to_cart
  # Get the item from the path
  @item = Item.find(params[:id])

  # Load the cart from the session, or create a new empty cart
  cart = session[:cart] || []

  # Add the item to the cart
  cart << @item.id

  # Save the cart in the session
  session[:cart] = cart
end
```

That's it! It's common to wrap this up in a helper method:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  helper_method :current_cart

  def current_cart
    session[:cart] ||= []
  end
end
```

So now our controller looks like this:

```ruby
# Routed from POST /items/:id/add_to_cart
def add_to_cart
  # Get the item from the path
  @item = Item.find(params[:id])

  # Load the cart from the session, or create a new empty cart and add the item to the cart
  current_cart << @item.id
end
```

This way, we can use `current_cart` in our views and layouts too. For example, we may want to show the user how many items are in their cart as part of the layout.

## Conclusion

Cookies are foundational for the modern web.

Most sites use cookies, either to let their users log in, to keep track of their shopping carts, or record other ephemeral session data. Almost nobody thinks these are bad uses of cookies: nobody really believes that you should have to type in your username and password on every page, or that your shopping cart should clear if you reload the page.

But cookies just let you store data in a user's browser, so by nature, they can be used for more controversial endeavors.

For example, Google AdWords sets a cookie and uses that cookie to track what ads you've seen and which ones you've clicked on. The tracking information helps AdWords decide what ads to show you.

That is why, if you click on an ad, you may find that the ad follows you around the Internet. It turns out that this behavior is as effective as it is annoying: people are far more likely to buy things from ads that they've clicked on once.

This use of cookies worries people and the EU [has created legislation around the use of cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#EU_cookie_directive).

Cookies, like any technology, are a tool. In the rest of the unit, we're going to be using them to let users log in. Whether you later want to use them in such a way that the EU passes another law is up to you.

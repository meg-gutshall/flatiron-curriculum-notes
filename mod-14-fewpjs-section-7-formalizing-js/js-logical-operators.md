# Logical Operators (JS Fundamentals)

Logical operators in JavaScript are the powerful backbone on which most website logic is based. Using JavaScript's three logical operators, NOT (`!`), AND (`&&`), and OR (`||`), we'll learn how to negate and combine expressions.

## How to Use `!` to Negate an Expression

### NOT (`!`)

The logical NOT operator (`!`), also called the _bang operator_, operates on an expression, returning the opposite of the expression's truthiness. If `x` resolves to a truthy value, `!x` returns `false`. If `x` is falsy, `!x` returns `true`:

```javascript
const truthyValue = 'This value is truthy.';

!truthyValue;
//=> false

const falsyValue = 0;

!falsyValue;
//=> true
```

## Convert an Expression to a Boolean Using `!!`

### Double Bang (`!!`)

In the lesson on conditional statements, we passed values into the `Boolean()` _constructor function_ to check their truthiness. For now, think of this constructor function as a function that takes in some input, creates a new boolean for that input, and outputs the created boolean.

A shorter way to convert any value into a boolean is to use two NOT operators:

```javascript
const truthyValue = 'This value is truthy.';

!truthyValue;
// => false

!!truthyValue;
// => true
```

Reading from left-to-right, the JavaScript engine sees the first `!` and looks to the right to check what we're asking it to invert (`!truthyValue`). It then sees the second `!` and look to the right _again_, this time finding our `truthyValue` variable. The engine resolves `truthyValue` to `"This value is truthy."` and then executes the second `!` operator on it. `!truthyValue` returns `false`, so instead of `!!truthyValue` we're now looking at `!false`. The remaining `!` operator then executes on `false`, inverting the falsy value and evaluating to `true`.

## The AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) Operators

### AND (`&&`)

The logical AND (`&&`) operator takes two expressions:

```javascript
expression1 && expression2;
```

The return value of the `&&` operator is always **one of the two expressions**. If the first expression is falsy, `&&` returns the value of the first expression. If the first expression is truthy, `&&` returns the value of the second expression. That means, if the first expression is falsy, `&&` returns that value and exits _without ever checking the second expression_:

```javascript
false && 'Anything';
//=> false

4 * 0 && 'Anything';
//=> 0
```

If the first expression is truthy, `&&` then returns whatever the second expression evaluates to:

```javascript
true && false;
//=> false

1 + 1 && 'Whatever';
//=> "Whatever"

'The truthiest of truthy strings' && 9 * 9;
//=> 81
```

There are three different ways the `&&` operator can be evaluated:

| Left side | Right side     | Return value | Truthiness of return value |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Falsy     | Doesn't matter | Left side    | Falsy                      |
| Truthy    | Falsy          | Right side   | Falsy                      |
| Truthy    | Truthy         | Right side   | Truthy                     |

1. If the left-side expression is falsy, the right-side expression doesn't matter at all. The `&&` operator returns the left side's falsy value and finishes.
2. If the left-side expression is truthy, the `&&` operator returns the right side's value (whether it's truthy or falsy) and finishes.

### OR (`||`)

The logical OR (`||`) operator also takes two expressions:

```javascript
expression1 || expression2
```

The return value of the `||` operator is always **one of the two expressions**. If the first expression is truthy, `||` returns the value of the first expression. If the first expression is falsy, `||` returns the value of the second expression.

If the first expression is truthy, that value is immediately returned and the second expression is never evaluated:

```javascript
true || 'Whatever';
//=> true

1 + 1 || 'Whatever';
//=> 2
```

If the first expression is falsy, `||` returns whatever the second expression evaluates to:

```javascript
false || 'Whatever';
//=> "Whatever"

1 === 2 || 8 * 8;
//=> 64

'' || 'Not ' + 'an ' + 'empty ' + 'string';
//=> "Not an empty string"
```

There are three different ways the `||` operator can be evaluated:

| Left side | Right side     | Return value | Truthiness of return value |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Truthy    | Doesn't matter | Left side    | Truthy                     |
| Falsy     | Truthy         | Right side   | Truthy                     |
| Falsy     | Falsy          | Right side   | Falsy                      |

1. If the left-side expression is truthy, the right-side expression doesn't matter at all. The `||` operator returns the life side's truthy value and completes.
2. If the left-side expression is falsy, the `||` operator returns the right side's value (regardless of whether it's truthy or falsy) and completes.

## How to Link Conditions Using the `&&` and `||` Operators

The `&&` and `||` operators are often used to link multiple conditions in a conditional statement:

```javascript
let user = 'Charles Babbage';
let friendCount = 3;
let message, messageColor;

if (user && friendCount) {
  message = `Hi ${user}! You have ${friendCount} ${friendCount === 1 ? 'friend' : 'friends'}!`;
} else if (user) {
  message = 'Link up with your friends to get the most out of Flatbook!';
} else {
  message = 'Please sign in.';
}
//=> "Hi Charles Babbage! You have 3 friends!"

if (message = 'Please sign in.' || message = 'Link up with your friends to get the most out of Flatbook!') {
  messageColor = 'red';
} else if (friendCount >= 1 && friendCount <= 10) {
  messageColor = 'blue';
} else if (friendCount >= 11 && friendCount <= 50) {
  messageColor = 'purple';
} else {
  messageColor = 'rainbow';
}
//=> "blue"
```

## Conclusion

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. Although they are called "logical," they can be applied to values of any typeâ€”not just boolean. The result can also be of any type. If a value can be converted to `true`, to value is so-called truthy; and if a value can be converted to `false`, the value is so-called falsy.

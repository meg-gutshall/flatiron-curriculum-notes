# Git Forks and Clones

- Forking a GitHub repository is just a way to create your own copy of it.
- Cloning lets us get a forked copy of the repository on our local machine.
- To clone in GitHub:
  - Navigate to the repository
  - Click the "Clone or download" green button on the right
  - Make sure you select `Use SSH` as your URL type
  - Click the "Copy to clipboard" button
  - In the terminal, run the `git clone` command followed by the URL as an argument
- The above steps will create a local copy of a GitHub repository.

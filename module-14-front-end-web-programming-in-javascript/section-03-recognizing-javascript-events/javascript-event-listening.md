# Lab: JavaScript Event Listening

JavaScript programmers often say we are "listening" for an event in order to "execute" or "call" a _callback function_.

## Defining Event Listeners on DOM Nodes with `addEventListener()`

`addEventListener()` is called on a node and takes two arguments:

1. The event name to listen for
2. The _callback function_ that will be executed when the node "hears" the event, "handling" the event

# Lab: Arithmetic Lab (JavaScript Fundamentals)

We're going to discuss a number of the common operators and objects we'll use to perform arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

## The Limitations of Math in JavaScript

**Math is awesome!** JavaScript has only a single, all-encompassing `Number` type. While other languages might have distinct types for integers, decimals, and the like, JavaScript represents everything as a double-precision floating-point number, or _float_. This imposes some interesting technical limitations on the precision of the arithmetic we can perform with JavaScript. For example:

```js
0.1 * 0.1;
//=> 0.010000000000000002
 
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1;
//=> 0.30000000000000004
 
1 - 0.9;
//=> 0.09999999999999998
```

You shouldn't waste too much time diving into why this happens, but it basically boils down to the language, once again, trying to be too user-friendly. Under the hood, JavaScript stores numbers in binary (base-2) format, as a series of `1`s and `0`s, but it displays numbers in the more human-readable decimal (base-10) format. The problem that the above code snippet highlights is that it's really easy to represent something like `1/10` in decimal (`0.1`) but impossible to do it in binary (`0.0001100110011...`). It's the exact same problem that the decimal system has in trying to represent `1/3` as `0.33333333333...`.

The only time you'd really have to worry about this is if you needed to calculate something to a high degree of precision, like interest payments for a bank. However, for most of our day-to-day arithmetic needs, JavaScript is more than capable.

## Employ Operators to Perform Arithmetic and Assign Values to Variables

JavaScript employs a pretty standard set of arithmetic operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

#### `+`

We've used the addition operator to concatenate strings, but it's also used to add numbers together:

```js
40 + 2;
//=> 42
```

#### `-`

The subtraction operator returns the difference between two numbers:

```js
9001 - 9000;
//=> 1
```

#### `*`

The multiplication operator returns the product of two numbers:

```js
6 * 7;
//=> 42
```

#### `/`

The division operator returns the result of the left number divided by the right number:

```js
9001 / 42;
//=> 214.3095238095238
```

#### `%`

The remainder operator returns the remainder when the left number is divided by the right number:

```js
9001 % 42;
//=> 13
```

#### `**`

The exponentiation operator returns the left number raised to the power of the right number:

```js
2 ** 8;
//=> 256
```

### Order of Operations

JavaScript evaluates compound arithmetic operations by following the standard order of operations used in basic math. Anything in parentheses has highest priority; exponentiation is second; then multiplication, division, and remainder; and, finally, addition and subtraction, in order from left to right.

`( )` --> `**` --> `*``/``%` --> `+``-`

This is how the JavaScript compiler works. For example:

```js
2 - (2 % 2) + (2 / 2 ** 2) * 2;
//=> 3

2 - ((2 % (2 + 2)) / 2 ** 2) * 2;
//=> 1
```

### Incrementing and Decrementing

JavaScript also has a pair of operators that we can use to increment and decrement a numerical value stored in a variable.

#### `++`

The `++` operator increments the stored number by `1`. If the `++` operator comes after the variable (e.g., `counter++`), the variable's value is _returned first and then incremented_:

```js
let counter = 0;
//=> undefined

counter++;
//=> 0

counter;
//=> 1
```

If the `++` operator comes before the variable (e.g., `++counter`), the variable's value is _incremented first and then returned_:

```js
let counter = 0;
//=> undefined

++counter;
//=> 1

counter;
//=> 1
```

In both case, `counter` contains the value `1` after incrementing. The difference is in whether we want the operation to return the original or incremented value.

#### `--`

The `--` operator decrements the stored number by `1` and has the same pair of prefix and postfix options as the `++` operator:

```js
let counter = 0;
//=> undefined

// Return the current value of 'counter' and then decrement by 1
counter--;
//=> 0

// Check the new value of 'counter'
counter;
//=> -1

// Decrement 'counter' and then return the new value
--counter;
//=> -2

// Check the new value of 'counter'
counter;
//=> -2
```

## Assignment Operators

JavaScript has a number of operators for assigning a value to a variable. We've already used the most basic, `=`, but we can also couple it with an arithmetic operator to perform an operation _and_ assign the value of the operation:

```js
let counter = 0;
//=> undefined

counter += 10;
//=> 10

counter -= 2;
//=> 8

counter *= 4;
//=> 32

counter /= 2;
//=> 16

counter %= 6;
//=> 4

counter **= 3;
//=> 64
```

## What Is `NaN`?

JavaScript tries to return a value for every operation, but sometimes we'll ask it to calculate the incalculable. For example, imagine that one of the lines of code in our program increments the value of a `counter` by `1`. However, something broke in a different part of the program, and `counter` is currently `undefined`. When the JavaScript engine reaches the incrementing line, what happens?

```js
counter++;
//=> NaN
```

The JavaScript engine can't add `1` to `undefined`, so it tells us the result is **Not a Number** â€” `NaN`.

**_Top Tip_:** Much like `undefined`, you should never assign `NaN` as the value of a variable and instead let it be a signal that some weird math is happening in your code.

## Use Built-in Objects Like `Math` and `Number` to Accomplish Complex Tasks

To satisfy most of our math needs, JavaScript provides several built-in objects that we can reference anywhere in JavaScript code, including `Number` and `Math`. With these objects, we can perform complex tasks like generating random numbers.

### `Number`

The `Number` object comes with a collection of handy methods that we can use for checking and converting numbers in JavaScript.

### `Number.isInteger()`

Checks whether the provided argument is an integer:

```js
Number.isInteger(42);
//=> true

Number.isInteger(0.42);
//=> false
```

### `Number.isFinite()`

Checks whether the provided argument is finite:

```js
Number.isFinite(9001);
//=> true

Number.isFinite(Infinity);
//=> false
```

### `Number.isNaN()`

Checks whether the provided argument is `NaN`:

```js
Number.isNaN(10);
//=> false

Number.isNaN(undefined);
//=> false

Number.isNaN(NaN);
//=> true
```

### `Number.parseInt()`

Accepts a string as its first argument and parses it as an integer. The second argument is the base that should be used in parsing (e.g., `2` for binary or `10` for decimal). For example, `100` is `100` in decimal but `4` in binary:

```js
Number.parseInt('100', 10);
//=> 100

Number.parseInt('100', 2);
//=> 4
```

The second argument is optional, but you should always provide it to avoid confusion.

### `Number.parseFloat()`

`Number.parseFloat()` only accepts a single argument: the string that should be parsed into a floating-point number:

```js
Number.parseFloat('3.14159');
//=> 3.14159
```

### `Math`

The `Math` object contains some properties representing common mathematical values, such as `Math.PI` and `Math.E`, as well as a number of methods for performing useful calculations.

### `Math.ceil()`/`Math.floor()`/`Math.round()`

JavaScript provides three methods for rounding numbers. `Math.ceil()` rounds the number _up_, `Math.floor()` rounds the number _down_, and `Math.round()` rounds the number either up or down, whichever is nearest:

```js
Math.ceil(0.5);
//=> 1

Math.floor(0.5);
//=> 0

Math.round(0.5);
//=> 1

Math.round(0.49);
//=> 0
```

### `Math.max()`/`Math.min()`

These two methods accept a number of arguments and return the highest and lowest constituent, respectively:

```js
Math.max(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
//=> 5

Math.min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
//=> 1
```

### `Math.random()`

This method generates a random number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive):

```js
Math.random();
//=> 0.4495507082209371
```

In combination with some simple arithmetic and one of the rounding methods, we can generate random integers within a specific range. For example, to generate a random integer between `1` and `10`:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
//=> 8

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
//=> 1

Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
//=> 6
```

`Math.random()` returns a number between `0` and `0.999...`, which we multiply by `10` to give us a number between `0` and `9.999...`. We then pass that number to `Math.floor()`, which returns an integer between `0` and `9`. That's one less than the desired range (`1` to `10`), so we add one at the end of the equation.

# Lesson: Demonstrate Front-End Web Programming Example

## Defining Web Programming

The phrase "Front-End Web Programming" is used in different ways by different people.

Web programming, at its heart, is:

- Creating documents with HTML and styling/positioning the document's content with CSS
- Using JavaScript to provide interactivity
- Using JavaScript to notify remote servers

## Web Page vs. Web Application

When a web page has a lot of JavaScript code, the page feels closer to a computer application, so people may call it a "web application". However, it's worth noting that there is no _**clear distinction**_ between a "web page" and a "web application"â€”it's just called an application when it feels "rich."

### Identify Reference Example: Liking on Social Media

**Web Programming Example: "Favoriting" a social media post.**

Regardless of the social media site, the interaction goes something like this:

1. The site renders some HTML content that is styled using CSS.
2. You see the content and decide to show your approval of it.
3. You _click_ some visual element meant to show approval (heart, thumbs-up, +1, etc.).
4. The visual element _updates_ (animates, goes from empty to full, jiggles, etc.).
5. Behind the scenes, the application _tells the provider_ that this post has gained your approval so that the central provider can store this information and use it later (for example, to notify the post author that you liked their post).

If all goes as it should, the entire interaction only takes a second or two. But even this small interaction demonstrates all the concepts of front-end web programming.

## Flatiron's "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

To help us learn web programming in three distinct phases, this curriculum is broken down into three essential "pillars":

- Recognize events
- Manipulate the DOM
- Communicate with the server

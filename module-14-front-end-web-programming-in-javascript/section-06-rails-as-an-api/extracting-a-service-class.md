# Code-along: Extracting a Service Class

We started to see how customizing JSON data in the controller works but can start to get pretty complicated. It is possible for a single comtroller action to render data from multiple models on our Rails API. It is also possible to specify what we want and don't want to render.

The complication comes when we start to scale. More models, more data, more pieces to customize until it becomes unmanageable.

## Our Initial Configuration

There are already three resources set up based on where we left off: birds, locations, and sightings. Birds and locations are related together through sightings:

```ruby
class Bird < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :sightings
  has_many :locations, through: :sightings
end
```

```ruby
class Location < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :sightings
  has_many :birds, through: :sightings
end
```

```ruby
class Sighting < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :bird
  belongs_to :location
end
```

And we left off with a messy combination of `include`, `only`, and `except` in order to customize which attributes we wanted to render to JSON:

```ruby
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    sighting = Sighting.find_by(id: params[:id])
    render json: sighting.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end
end
```

Although this is difficult to read, it does work. With this action in place, visiting `http://localhost:3000/sightings/2` produces the following set of data:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "bird_id": 2,
  "location_id": 2,
  "created_at": "2020-03-15T16:38:37.225z",
  "bird": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Grackle",
    "species": "Quiscalus Quiscula"
  },
  "location": {
    "id": 2,
    "latitude": 30.26715,
    "longitude": -97.74306
  }
}
```

We can use the same render statement in an `index` without having to change it:

```ruby
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    sightings = Sighting.all
    render json: sightings.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end

  def show
    sighting = Sighting.find_by(id: params[:id])
    render json: sighting.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end
end
```

However, the way things are presents some problems. Having to include this in every controller action would not be very DRY. In addition, as mentioned before, it is difficult to read, and equally difficult to write and update without making errors.

There is also a separate issueâ€”controllers are really meant to act as a relay between our models and our view, or well, our rendered JSON in this case. If we can extract the work of customizing our JSON data and put it somewhere else, we could keep our controller actions cleaner.

Let's resolve this issue before resolving the issue of readability. One way to resolve this issue is to build a service class.

## Creating a Service Class

A service class is a class specific to our domain that handles some of the business logic of the application. In this case, we are looking to handle the logic of arranging our JSON data the way we want it.

In the `SightingsController`, we already have working render statements. Our goal is not to change these statements, just move the work off of the controller.

To create a class we will be able to utilize in place of the current render statements, we'll need to first create a new folder withing `app` called `services`:

```sh
mkdir app/services
```

Then we'll need to create a service class to use in our `SightingsController`. Since we're specifically arranging and serving up data, we'll create a class called `SightingSerializer` and save it in the `services` folder as `sighting_serializer.rb`:

```sh
touch app/services/sighting_serializer.rb
```

This can be a plain Ruby class without the need to inherit from anything:

```ruby
class SightingSerializer
end
```

Once a new class and file are created this way, you'll need to restart the Rails server if it is running in order for `SightingSerializer` to be recognized and available in places like `SightingsController`.

## Configure the New Serializer

Looking back at `SightingsController`, we are currently calling the `to_json` method on the variables `sightings` and `sighting` in the two controller actions:

```ruby
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    sightings = Sighting.all
    render json: sightings.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end

  def show
    sighting = Sighting.find_by(id: params[:id])
    render json: sighting.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end
end
```

Remember that everything following `to_json` is the same for both actions. The goal of our new serializer class is to replace this without having to change too much.

We will approach configuring the serializer in two steps. First, we will want to define an `initialize` method for the class. If you recall from object-oriented Ruby, we use the `initialize` method to set up any instance variables that we might want to share over multiple methods. In this case, `initialize` will take in whatever variable we're dealing with in a particular action and store it as an instance variable:

```ruby
class SightingSerializer
  def initialize(sighting_object)
    @sighting = sighting_object
  end
end
```

Now, whatever we pass when initializing a new instance of `SightingSerializer` will be stored as `@sighting`. We will need access to this variable elsewhere in the `SightingSerializer`, so an instance variable is needed here.

The second step is to write a method that will call `to_json` on this instance variable, handling the inclusion and exclusion of attributes, and return the results. We will call this method `to_serialized_json`, and for now we can directly copy the `to_json` logic that currently exists in `SightingsController`:

```ruby
class SightingSerializer
  def initialize(sighting_object)
    @sighting = sighting_object
  end

  def to_serialized_json
    @sighting.to_json(:include => {
      :bird => { :only => [:name, :species] },
      :location => { :only => [:latitude, :longitude] }
    }, :except => [:updated_at])
  end
end
```

With this setup, once an instance of `SightingSerializer` is created, we can call `to_serialized_json` on it to get our data customized and ready to go as a JSON string!

Now it is time to clean up `SightingsController` and replace the original render statements with our new service class:

```ruby
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    sightings = Sighting.all
    render json: SightingSerializer.new(sightings).to_serialized_json
  end

  def show
    sighting = Sighting.find_by(id: params[:id])
    render json: SightingSerializer.new(sighting).to_serialized_json
  end
end
```

Extraction complete! We've resolved the issue of keeping our controller clear of excess logic by moving it to a separate class. However, we still haven't made our `to_json` any easier to read.

## Organizing Options

In the `to_serialized_json` method, we are passing multiple options into `to_json` when it is called. These options are just key/value pairs in a hash though, and we can choose to break this line up to get a better grasp of what is actually going on. Rewriting the method without changing any functionality, we could write:

```ruby
def to_serialized_json
  options = {
    include: {
      bird: {
        only: [:name, :species]
      },
      location: {
        only: [:latitude, :longitude]
      }
    },
    except: [:updated_at]
  }
  @sighting.to_json(options)
end
```

Above, we define a variable, `options`, assigning it to an empty hash. We then define a key on that hash, `include`, assigning it to the same hash we had previously, and the same for `except`.

This time, instead of filling `to_json` with a long list of options, we pass in the `options` hash.

## Conclusion

With a fully extracted `SightingSerializer`, we are able to leave our controller free of clutter and extra logic. We're able to write a small class and utilize its methods multiple times, rather than repeat ourselves. Meanwhile, we now have the space within that class to make our code as easy to understand as possible.

# Lesson: Intro to Version Control

## Notes

- Version control is the process of storing multiple versions of a single project, allowing each version to be recalled at a later date.
- Using version control is useful because it allows you to easily rollback to a previous version of your application.
  - Other advantages: keeps a backup of your work, facilitates collaboration, and gives freedom for code experimentation
- In a distributed version control system, all users have a complete copy of the entire repository (the location where all the files for a particular project are stored). This means you can work on the project independent of any network connection and push your changes to the server and merge with the server's repository upon reconnecting.
- The Flatiron School uses the distributed version control system Git.

# Lesson: Text Formatting

## Notes

### `<p>`

The `<p>` stands for _paragraph_, and is used to wrap text with some built in formatting rules. Always make sure to close your tags! If you've left a tag open, subsequent tags may be interpreted by the browser as _nested_ within the first tag.

### `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`

We indicate headings and subheadings in our page by using _heading_ tags, written from largest to smallest as `<h1>` down to `<h6>`. Headings are useful for search engine optimization, with the largest heading, `<h1>`, carrying the highest importance to search engines.

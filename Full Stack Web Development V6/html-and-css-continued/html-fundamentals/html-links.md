# Lesson: HTML Links

## Notes

- The last thing we want to do for our basic site is to link all of our pages together. We create links using the _anchor link_ element, written as `<a>`. The `<a>` tag requires an `href` attribute to tell the browser where we want the link to go to.
- Use a relative path for internal links and a full path for external links.
- The `target` attribute determines how the link will be opened. By default, links are opened in the current browser tab but setting this attribute to be `target="_blank"` will cause the browser to open a new tab when the link is clicked.

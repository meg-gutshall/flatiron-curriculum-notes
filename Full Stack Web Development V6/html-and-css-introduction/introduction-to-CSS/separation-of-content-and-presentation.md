# Lesson: Separation of Content and Presentation

## Notes

- HTML authors believe that creating marked-up documents and styling marked-up documents are entirely separate tasks. They see a difference between writing content (the data within the HTML document) and specifying presentation, the rules for displaying the rendered elements. We use HTML for content and for presentation we use CSS.
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
  - It tells us how to write rules that define how browsers will present HTML.
  - These rules usually live in a file apart from our HTML file.

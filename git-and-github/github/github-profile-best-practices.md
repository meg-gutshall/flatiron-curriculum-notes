# Lesson: GitHub Profile Best Practices

## Notes

- Pin projects to the top of your profile
  - Highlight your most impressive, large, and/or recent projects first.
  - Try to show diversity by displaying projects using different languages or technologies.
- Add project descriptions and tags
  - EVERY project should have a description
  - Descriptions should include a few sentences about functionality, languages and/or major tools used. Be concise while explaining what the project is about. Have a small, one-sentence description.
  - Include a link to a live site where your project is hosted.
- Add a readme for every project
  - gifs are highly recommended
  - Should be longer than the description and cover the app functionality
  - Include links to blog posts about the project
- Fill out all profile information
- Commit often
  - Make consistent (daily) contributions to your GitHub profile.
- Contribute to open source projects
  - Having pull requests/issues/reviews visible on your profile makes you stand out.
- If you fork code, actually work on it
  - Create meaningful contributions to other people’s code; if you want to note a fork to return to later, delete the fork, but star the repo it came from.
  - Your GitHub should communicate that you can build purposeful, meaningful apps and features.
- Focus on project structure and organization
  - Use relevant and well-known design patterns/file structure
- Have clean, east to read code on your GitHub
  - Functions should be responsible for one thing in general.
  - Keep your code modular and don't repeat yourself. Keep methods small, and create a chunk you can reuse in different places and stack in different orders. Stay away from 'copy and paste'.
- Bonus Tips
  - Building out tests is impressive—especially at a junior level.
  - Add comments into your code.

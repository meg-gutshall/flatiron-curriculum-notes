# Lesson: GitHub Pull Requests

## Notes

- The concept of a pull request is unique to GitHub and powers the communities of developers who create adn contribute to "open sourced" projects.
- A pull request is a request to the owner of another repo to take changes you made in a branch on your fork of their repo and integrate it into theirs as if you had done the work on theirs directly.
- A pull request is actually a `git merge`, not a `git pull`.
- To create a `pull request`, go to your fork of the code in GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. Choose the base fork as the original copy and the head fork as your copy then click "Create pull request".
- As long as a pull request already exists, the commits will be added automatically.

# Lesson: Transitioning from Ruby to HTML

## Notes

- Regardless of the programming language, if the application presents screens, or "interfaces" in HTML, it's ready to share its capabilities with billions of people on the web from its very first moment "out there!"
- Given that the web will be our publication mechanism for our "interfaces," our code will need to generate the "right" HTML.
- If you're not confident with both reading and writing HTML, you will not be able to develop and debug your application.
- **All pathways to web programming success rely on strength in HTML.**

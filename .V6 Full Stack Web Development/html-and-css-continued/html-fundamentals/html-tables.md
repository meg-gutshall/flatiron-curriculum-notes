# Lesson: HTML Tables

## Notes

### `<table> </table>`

To add a table, we first need to write opening and closing `<table>` tags. This tells our browser to interpret anything inside as part of the table. Inside these tags, we'll use a few other elements to designate the rows, headers, and cells of the table.

### `<tr> </tr>`

To make a row inside our table, we use the _table row_ tag, `<tr>`. Any content we want in a row would go inside that particular `<tr>`.

### `<th> </th>`

Tables generally start with a row of headers to label columns for the rows below. To do this, we use `<th>`, the _table header_ tag.

### `<td> </td>`

In the next row down, we can start putting our information. In this row, instead of using the _table header_ tag, we want to use the _table data_ tag, `<td>`, which will represent one table cell. As long as each bit of data in a `<td>` is in the same position as the corresponding `<th>`, it will show up in that column.

# Rails as an API

Rails itself can serve as both the frontend and backend of a website, but it can also be configured specifically to work as an API.

An API, short for Application Programming Interface, put broadly, is a way for one system to communicate with other _external systems_. An API abstracts away any of the complicated logic of a system and presents something that is easier to interact with or build upon, whether the API is serving up useful functions, services, or data. In relation to web development, APIs are often sources of data that we can use in our own applications.

Using Rails, _we can create our own APIs from scratch_. If you've got hold of some data that you'd love to share with others, you could build an API and share that information on the web. In addition, Rails APIs render JSON strings, which is particularly convenient, since we can use them when building frontends using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous requests.

As we go through the process of setting up and configuring APIs, we will also look at different ways in which we can organize the data the API is prociding. As the creator of an API, you have full control over how information is structured, and must always consider how that structure effects your code.

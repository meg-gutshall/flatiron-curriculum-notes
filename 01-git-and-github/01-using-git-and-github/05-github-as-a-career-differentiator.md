# Lesson: Thinking Ahead: GitHub as Career Differentiator

## Tips for a Strong GitHub Profile

### 1. Pin Projects to the Top of Your Profile

Highlight you most impressive, large, and/or recent projects at the top of your GitHub page. The first thing an employer should see is what you've been working on most recently (your current skill set). Try to make your projects diverse as well to show that you possess a variety of skills.

### 2. Add Project Descriptions and Tags

Every project should have a detailed description. Descriptions should include a few sentences about functionality, languages, and/or major tools used. Be concise while explaining what the project is about—just include it's purpose and highlights. Descriptions should also include a link to a live site and/or a video demo.

### 3. Add a `README` for Every Project

- All projects should have a README attached. They can include wireframes or videos demonstrating project design and/or functionality. A README differs from a project description as it should be longer, and about project functionality. Add a link to your live app, a link to a blog post, or even a thumbnail link to a YouTube demo video here.

### 4. Fill out ALL Profile Information

Include your name, contact info, and location at the very least. Recruiters use search tools and filter out profiles based on location. Having this information on your profile make it easy for them to find you.

### 5. Commit Often

Show that you're actively coding. Make consistent, daily contributions to your GitHub profile. Your daily activity will show potential employers your level of activity each day, week, month—and commits should be frequent. Employers look for this!

### 6. Contribute to Open Source Projects

This shows that you can work well with a community, you know how to dive into large codebases/datasets, and can adapt to different coding/programming standards. Having pull requests/issues/reviews visible on your profile makes you stand out.

### 7. If You Fork Code, Actually Work on It

Create meaningful contributions to other people's code. If you want to note a fork to return to later, delete the fork, but star the repo it came from. Your GitHub should communicate that you can build purposeful, meaningful apps/projects and features.

### 8. Focus on Project Structure and Organization

In regards to architecture and design, make sure it is easy to figure out where to go in the project to locate the various functional areas and layers. Use relevant and well-known design patterns/file structures.

### 9. Have Clean, Easy-to-Read Code on Your GitHub Profile

Functions should be responsible for one thing in general. Keep your code modular and DRY. Keep methods small and create a chunk you can reuse in different places as well as stack in different orders.

## Bonus Tips

### Are There Tests?

Building out tests is impressive—especially at a junior level. [Check out this article](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters) for tips on how to write testable code and why it matters.

### Are There Comments on Code?

In a great code base, you'll see a line about each code before writing the method, giving a description of what it does. On your next big project, start adding in comments—this will prepare you for working on a common code base at your future developer gig, and demonstrate to employers that you're ready to collaborate effectively.

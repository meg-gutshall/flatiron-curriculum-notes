# Map Lab (Iterators Drill)

As developers, we find ourselves responsible for all sorts of common, but tedious, tasks, such as iterating over arrays. Although a `for` loop or nesting in lists and collections will complete the task, we can take advantage of a method like `map()` to organize and optimize our code into building blocks of functions, which we can then chain together to create more readable and understandable functions.

## How the `map()` Method Works

`Array.prototype.map()` is an array method that iterates over all elements, allowing you to apply a function to each element in that array, and changing them into something else. The result is then returned as a _new array_, leaving the original array unmodified (but remember, **not** the elements we modify, that requires defensive copying). This is super important because it saves us from having to create a new array ourselves to copy stuff into there, **or** modifying the original elements in the array, which we may need later.

## Demonstrate `map()` with Arrays

We use `map()` when we want to perform an action on each element in the collection and "gather" the results into a new array.

We'll also use this as a chance to demonstrate some of the power of functions in JavaScript. We'll write `map()` **four times** so you can see how the iterator functions allow us to write more _expressive_ code.

### `for` and `for...of`

In this example, we are using a standard bit of iteration code. Because `for` and `for...of` are _general_ functions that can be used to do lots of things, another programmer won't be sure if the inner workings return values are important or not. For example:

```javascript
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = [];

for (const student of students) {
  rollCall.push( student + " the wizard" );
};

//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

When we write `.map()`, we are saying to other programmers: "Expect a new array to come out of this after each element is touched."

### `map()` with a Function Declaration

```javascript
function studentRollCall(student) {
  return student + " the wizard";
};

let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map(studentRollCall);
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

With `map()`, we have a list of _n_ things and want that list of _n_ things to be transformed. Here, we're passing a function _as an argument_. Arguments can be things like numbers or strings, and, in JavaScript, **they can also be work.** Very few other programming languages allow that!

The iterator function `map()` expects to be _passed a function as an argument_ which they will hand each of their elements off to. In the case of `map()`, it hands each element to the function and stores the return value of the function into a new array.

This code is more _expressive_ because it lives up to the promise of `map()`. It creates a new array after each element is "touched" be a function.

One drawback to this code is that the `studentRollCall` function doesn't do much work. It just returns something that the `student` _already_ knew how to do. What if we use a function expression ("anonymous function") instead?

### `map()` with a Function Expression

```javascript
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map(function(student) {
  return student + " the wizard";
});
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

That's much shorter and it has all the same advantages of the previous version.

### `map()` with an Arrow Function

Thanks to arrow functions, we can shorten up the function expression to:

```javascript
// When the parameter list is only one element, we can drop ()!
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map( student => student + " the wizard" )
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

The code now fits on one line! This is much less noisy JavaScript code, so the _expressiveness_ has increased: `rollCall` is the resulting of mapping `students`.

## Using `map()` with Complex Data Structures

Let's use the `map()` function on a trickier data structureâ€”a list of robots. To start things off, we have an array of robots. Now, let's activate all of them. An activated robot needs to be marked as such using the `isActivated` boolean, as well as have its number of modes doubled:

```javascript
const robots = [
  { name: "Johnny 5", modes: 5, isActivated: false },
  { name: "C3PO", modes: 3, isActivated: false },
  { name: "Sonny", modes: 2.5, isActivated: false },
  { name: "Baymax", modes: 1.5, isActivated: false }
];

const activatedRobots = robots.map(function (robot) {
  return Object.assign({}, robot, {
    modes: robot.modes * 2,
    isActivated: true
  });
});

console.log(activatedRobots);

/* Expected Output:
  [
    { name: "Johnny 5", modes: 10, isActivated: true },
    { name: "C3PO", modes: 6, isActivated: true },
    { name: "Sonny", modes: 5, isActivated: true },
    { name: "Baymax", modes: 3, isActivated: true }
  ]
*/
```

With the native `map()` function that is a property of the array's prototype, it gives us the exact same result! Now that we know how `map()` is implemented, it holds no more secrets for us. We can discard our own `map()` function and just use the `map()` property on arrays.

## Conclusion

`map()` takes two arguments: a callback and the optional context. The callback runs for each value in an array and returns each new value in the resulting array. It returns a new array that is the same length as the original array and saves time while making the code simpler and easy to read.

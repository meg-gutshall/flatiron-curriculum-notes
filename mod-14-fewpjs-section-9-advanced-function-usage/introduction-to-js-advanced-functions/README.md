# Introduction (JS Advanced Functions)

## On Character and Programming Languages

As you learn more about other programming languages, you'll come to realize that they each have a point of viewâ€”themes and patterns that may be unique to them that will become more obvious as you become familiar with them. Consider some of your favorite authors or artists; many of them likely to have a certain style that gives their work away without it being explicitly stated.

JavaScript also has a fundamental point of view: **JavaScript loves functions.**

JavaScript makes this love clear from our first encounter with functions. It makes functions first-class data. Functions, that is to say, "frozen" _work_, can be passed around like "primitive" data (strings, integers, etc.). JavaScript passes around its functions, shoves them into arrays, makes them accessible via a _key_ in an object, and more. Few other programming languages share this point of view.

## On Personal Character and Programming Languages

Because of JavaScript's uncommon love for functions, developers sometimes get stymied by difficult bugs and they blame the language for it. This is unfortunate. Don't fall victim to this pattern of behavior with JavaScript (or, with much of anything in life): seek to understand its point of view and appreciate the growth that search provides.

Approach JavaScript with curiosity and appreciation and JavaScript will show you a whole new way of thinking about the world.

Those who _do_ understand JavaScript's point of view are able to:

* Write compact code that works in a wide variety of situations
* Grasp the design approaches of new JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
* Debug subtle, yet tricky bugs

These are all abilities worth having! So let's get to know the mind of JavaScript by learning some of the amazingly cool things we can do with functions.

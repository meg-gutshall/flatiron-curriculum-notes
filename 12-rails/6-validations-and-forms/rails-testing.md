# Lesson: Rails Testing

One of the most fundamental aspects of programmer productivity is **the feedback loop**. "Scripting" languages like Ruby and Python are great for this because you can run you code immediately after writing it. Conversely, lower-level languages like C must be compiled before being run.

## The Feedback Loop

1. Decide what to do next
2. Think of an approach
3. Write some code
4. Compile/run the code
5. Observe the output
6. If it looks good, move on to Step 1 for the next task.
7. If there are problems, go back to Step 1 for this task.

Having a short feedback loop lowers the resistance for trying new things and protects you from distractions that sneak in while you're waiting between steps.

Rails ships with many features to save precious seconds in developer feedback loops, but there's no two ways about it: in anything but the most trivial app, it can be pretty complex to make sure your code is actually working correctly.

In this lesson, we'll learn to shorten our feedback loop with different flavors of Rails tests, combining some standard approaches suggested in the Guides themselves with some more advanced practices that require additional dependencies (namely Capybara).

## Three Test Types

We'll be covering three types of tests:

- Models (RSpec)
- Controllers (RSpec)
- Features (RSpec/Capybara)

Features are the fanciest so we'll leave them for last. They are preferred over regular Rails "View" tests.

## RSpec

By default, Rails uses `Test::Unit` for testing, which keeps its tests in the mysteriously-named `test/` folder.

If you're planning from the start to use RSpec instead, you can tell Rails to skip `Test::Unit` by passing the `-T` flag to `rails new`. Then, you will add `gem 'rspec-rails'` to your Gemfile and use the built-in generator to add a `spec` folder with the right boilerplate:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rails g rspec:install
```

This is the Rails equivalent of the usual `rspec --init`.

## An Automobile Analogy

It's no enough to know _how_ to test applications; we must also understand _why_ it makes sense to test them in a certain way. To help with this, try thinking of Rails applications like cars:

- **Models** are the **basic parts** that make cars useful, like the fuel take, engine, and tires.
- **Views** are the **interactive parts** that the driver (user) can see and touch, like the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift.
- **Controllers** are the rest of the **connecting parts** under the hood that connect the views to the models, like how the steering column (along with the rest of the steering assembly) connects the wheel to the tires. The users don't really see them, think of them, or even necessarily know they exist, but they're just a necessary.

Models are not too difficult to test because they have very specific purposes that can be easily separated from the rest of the application.

## Model Tests

These go in `spec/models`, on file per model.

Model tests use the least amount of special features, since all you really need is the model class itself. The most common usage for model tests is to make sure you have set up your validations correctly.

Suppose we're working with this model:

```ruby
# app/models/monster.rb

class Monster < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :size, inclusion: {in: ["tiny", "average", "like, REALLY big"]}
  validates :taxonomy, format: {with: /\A[A-Z](\.|[a-z]+) [a-z]{2,}\z/, message: "must include genus and species, like 'Homo sapiens'"}
end
```

### Testing for Validity

First, we'll make sure that it understands a valid Monster:

```ruby
# spec/models/monster_spec.rb

describe Monster do
  let(:attributes) do
    {
      name: "Dustwing",
      size: "tiny",
      taxonomy: "Abradacus nonexistus"
    }
  end

  it "is considered valid" do
    expect(Monster.new(attributes)).to be_valid
  end
end
```

Some questions to answer first:

#### What is `let`

If you haven't seen `let` before, it is a [standard helper method](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/helper-methods/let-and-let) that takes a symbol and a block. It runs the block **once per example** in which it is called and saves the return value in a local variable named according to the symbol. This means you get a fresh copy in every test case.

#### Why is `let` better than `before :each`

It's more fine-grained, which means you have better control over your data. It can be used in combination with `before` statements to set up your test data _just right_ before the examples are run.

#### Why did we use `let` to make an attribute hash

We could have put the entire `Monster.new` call inside our `let` block, but using our attribute hash instead has some advantages:

- If we want to tweak the data first, we can just pass `attributes.merge(name: "Other")` while preserving the rest of the attributes.
- We can also refer to `attributes` when making assertions about what the actual object should look like.

It's a good balance between saving keystrokes and maintaining the flexibility of your test data.

#### Where does `be_valid` come from

RSpec provides plenty of built-in matchers, which you can peruse in their [API docs](http://rspec.info/documentation/3.4/rspec-expectations/frames.html#!RSpec/Matchers.html), but `be_valid` is conspicuously absent from the list.

This code uses a neat trick that RSpec refers to as "[predicate matchers](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers/predicate-matchers)", and you'll see it **a lot** in Rails testing.

In Ruby, it's conventional for methods that return `true` or `false` to be named with a question mark at the end. These methods are called **predicate methods**, because "predicate" is an English grammar term for the part of a sentence that makes a statement about the subject.

As you learned earlier in this unit, Rails provides a `valid?` methods that returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the model object in question passed its validations.

In RSpec, when you call a nonexistent matcher (such as `be_valid`), it strips off the `be_` (`valid`), adds a question mark (`valid?`), and checks to see if the object responds to a method by that name (`monster.valid?`).

### Testing for Validation Failure

Now, let's add some tests to make sure our validation are working in the opposite direction:

```ruby
# spec/models/monster_spec.rb

let(:missing_name) {attributes.except(:name)}
let(:invalid_size) {attributes.merge(size: "not that big")}
let(:missing_species) {attributes.merge(taxonomy: "Abradacus")}

it "is invalid without a name" do
  expect(Monster.new(missing_name)).not_to be_valid
end

it "is invalid with an unusual size" do
  expect(Monster.new(invalid_size)).not_to be_valid
end

it "is invalid with a missing species" do
  expect(Monster.new(missing_species)).not_to be_valid
end
```

Note that each of these `let` blocks rely on the first one, `attributes`, which contains all of our valid attributes. `missing_name` uses the Rails hash helper `except` to exclude the `name` key while the other two use the standard Ruby `merge` method to overwrite valid attributes with invalid ones.

### Other RSpec Features

Several RSpec features have been moved over time into the [rspec-collection_matchers](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-collection_matchers) gem, which can maker some detailed assertions more readable. Also `should` is an old RSpec syntax that has been deprecated in favor of `expect`.

## Controller Tests

The biggest risk in writing controller tests is redundancy: controllers exist to connect views and models, so it's difficult to test them in isolation.

First, we'll go over **how** to write controller tests. Then, our discussion of the **why** will bring us into the final subject, "feature tests".

```ruby
# spec/controllers/monsters_controller_spec.rb

describe MonstersController, type: :controller do
  let(:attributes) do
    {
      name: "Dustwing",
      size: "tiny",
      taxonomy: "Abradacus nonexistus"
    }
  end

  it "renders the show template" do
    monster = Monster.create!(attributes)
    get :show, id: monster.id
    expect(response).to render_template(:show)
  end

  describe "creation" do
    before {post :create, monster: attributes}
    let(:monster) {Monster.find_by(name: "Dustwing")}

    it "creates new monster" do
      expect(monster).to_not be_nil
    end

    it "redirects to the monster's show page" do
      expect(response).to redirect_to(monster_path(monster))
    end
  end
end
```

You can use the `GET` and `POST` methods (along with `PATCH` and `DELETE`) to initiate test requests on the controller. A `response` object is available to set expectations on, such as `render_template` or `redirect_to`.

The tests above are great, especially while we're still getting user to how controllers are wired. However, almost these exact tests could be copied for _any_ controller set up according to Rails' RESTful conventions. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but the redundance, along with the need to test views, inspired the creation of a new type of test supported by Capybara known as a "Feature Test".

## Feature Tests

If you were going to write tests for a cat's steering wheel, what would you start with?

Here's one idea:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*When the steering wheel is rotated to the left, the tires rotate to the left.*

This makes sense, but it's testing much more than the steering wheel. This test relies on the view (steering wheel), the model (tires), _and_ the controller (steering column)!

This is called an **acceptance test** because it is phrased in terms of features that provide value to the user. (It could also be called an **integration test** because it tests more than one piece of the system at once.)

Can we isolate the steering wheel while still testing its functionality?

Not reallyâ€”the whole point of the steering wheel is to control the tires. We could talk about how it looks or what it's made of, but the functionality is inherently tied to the underlying system, just like the views in a Rails app. All of those forms and templates are meaningless without controllers and models to populate them.

In the last section, we did our best to isolate the controller, and, as a result, we wrote many of our tests in terms of the controller's internal parts (such as redirects and request methods). We don't care what the HTML look like, what button the user pressed, or how the models are behaving.

This is called a **unit test**, because it tests a single unit of functionality.

For a car, it might look like this:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*When the steering column's flange rotates, the steering shaft transmits the rotation of the steering box.*

It can be difficult to write isolated **unit tests**, and it's not always clear whether they're useful. Compare the jargon-heavy, extremely specific unit test, above, to the test covering the steering wheel (view) _and_ steering column (controller):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*When the steering wheel is rotated to the left, the steering column transmits the rotation to the steering box.*

This is a **feature test**.

The **acceptance test** at the top of this section covers too much ground, making it brittle and difficult to maintain. The **unit test** in the middle of this section is so specific that it almost feels like we just rewrote the controller code with different phrasing. The **feature test** on the other hand, is just right. It lets us think like a user (in terms of the steering wheel, or view) while still making intelligent assertions about how the underlying system should respond to input (in terms od the steering column, or controller).

Now, on to the _how_.

### Capybara

When you see keywords like `visit`, `fill_in`, and `page`, you know you're looking at a [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) test.

To set up Capybara, one must first add the gem to the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'Capybara'
```

Then set up Capybara-Rails integration in `spec/rails_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb

require 'capybara/rails'
```

Then set up Capybara-RSpec integration in `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb

require 'capybara/rspec'
```

Feature tests are traditionally located in `spec/features`, but you can put them anywhere if you pass the `:type => :feature` option to your `describe` call.

To test our monster manager with Capybara, we'll start by setting up a `GET` request and then use Capybara's convenient helper functions to interact with the page just like a user would:

```ruby
# spec/features/monster_creation.rb

describe "monster creation", type: :feature do
  before do
    visit new_monster_path
    fill_in "Name", with: "Dustwing"
    select "tiny", from: "monster_size"
    fill_in "Taxonomy", with: "Abradacus nonexistus"
    click_button "Create Monster"
  end
```

When `click_button` is called, this will trigger the `POST` request to the controller's `create` action, just as if a user had clicked it in their browser.

Now, we can write our original controller tests like usual:

```ruby
# spec/features/monster_creation.rb

let(:monster {Monster.find_by(Name: "Dustwing")})

it "creates a monster" do
  expect(monster).to_not be_nil
end

it "redirects to the new monster's page" do
  expect(current_path).to eq(monster_path(monster))
end
```

And because we're in Capybara land, we also have a very convenient way of making assertions about the final `GET` request:

```ruby
# spec/features/monster_creation.rb

it "displays the monster's name" do
  within "h1" do
    expect(page).to have_content(monster.name)
  end
end
```

`within` sets the context for our next expectation, restricting it to the first `<h1>` tag encountered on the page. This way, our `expect` call will only pass if the specified content (`"Dustwing"`) appears inside that first heading.

One interesting thing about this approach is that we're being much _less_ explicit about certain expectations. For example, we're testing the redirect not with the initial `302` response but instead by examining the current path in Capybara's virtual "browser session". This is much more powerful and intuitive, and it doesn't sacrifice much in the way of expressivity.

## Summary

The hardest part about testing usually ends up being the "why" and not the "how". Why write the test this way and not that way?

You will probably see Capybara feature tests in wider usage than direct controller and view tests, but they're not universal. If you're doing something unusual, like a series of complex redirects that can change based on authorization level, it makes sense to write a more isolated controller test. But for standard CRUD functionality, Capybara is designed to save you a lot fo time and mental effort.

These can serve as fairly reliable guidelines:

- Models should always be thoroughly unit tested.
- Controllers should be as thin as possible to keep your feature tests simple.
- If you can't avoid making a controller complex, it deserves its own isolated test.
- Capybara's syntax is much more powerful than Rails' built-in functionality for view tests, so stick with it whenever possible.
- Don't get carried away with the details when testing views: you just need to make sure the information is in the right place. If your tests are too strict, it will be impossible to make even simple tweaks to your templates without breaking the build.

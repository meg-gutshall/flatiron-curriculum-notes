# Lesson: Interpolation Super Power

## Notes

- String interpolation allows us to evaluate Ruby code, and inject the return value into the middle of a string.
  - We're not just limited to injecting simple variables, though. We can do slightly fancier things if we just think of the pound sign/curly braces (`#{}`) as delimiters that allow us to run arbitrary code in the middle of a string.

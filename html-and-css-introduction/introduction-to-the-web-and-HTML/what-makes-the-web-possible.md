# Lesson: What Makes the Web Possible?

## Notes

To make the web work we need:

1. A common language (HTML)
2. A way to serve content (Web servers)
3. A way to view content (Web browsers)
4. servers and browsers should have an agreed-upon way of exchanging data (HTML)
5. A way to send HTTP request to any computer connected to the network (The Internet)

### The Internet

- There would be no web without Internet
  - The Internet provides addresses to the clients and servers so that they can exchange information as well as error-connection and reconnection rules.
- Technologists say that **the web is an Internet application**, but it is not the only one.

### HTML

- HTML is the language of the web. Every website ever created is expressed using HTML.

### Web Servers

- Web servers make our content available to everyone on the Internet. Web servers are our content publishers (from a technical point of view).

### Web Browsers

- Web browsers know how to translate HTML code into something that is pleasant to read for a human.

### HTTP

- HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
- The convention (standard) for servers and browsers to exchange data is HTTP, or, in networking parlance, a "network protocol".
- It's how web browsers speak to web servers and ask the servers to send them payloads of HTML (like a handshake and a request).

### Recap

1. The Internet allows browsers and servers to connect to each other.
2. Browsers and server interact with an agreed-upon protocol: HTTP.
3. Content is represented as HTML documents.
4. HTML documents are published by web servers.
5. HTML documents are viewed using web browsers.

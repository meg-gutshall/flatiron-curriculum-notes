# Lesson: Text to the Infinity and Beyond

## Notes

- HTML stands for hypertext markup language.
- The texts, or "strings", sent back and forth on the web are HTML documents, containing both content and markup.
  - Content is actual English language text.
  - Markup is HTML elements.
- The browser receives an HTML document from the server, then uses it to display a non-markup version in the browser.
  - It displays only the content of the HTML document but uses the HTML elements to determine how the content is meant to be structured and displayed.
  - This display is called a rendered page.
  - Right-click and select "View Page Source" on any website to see the HTML document that the browser used to "render" the site.

# Lesson: Nested Tags and Attributes

## Notes

- Whenever we nest an HTML tag inside of another tag, we indent the inner tag so that the overall hierarchy is clear.
- An HTML attribute is extra information we can add to a tag to identify, classify, style, or modify the default behavior of the element the tag contains.
- A common use case for HTML attributes is element identification (`id` attribute) and/or classification (`class` attribute). The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within the whole document. The `class` attribute is used to group together similar elements.
  - Both `<id>` and `<class>` attributes are often used for styling purposes since they allow us to find a specific element or style similar elements with a single style declaration.

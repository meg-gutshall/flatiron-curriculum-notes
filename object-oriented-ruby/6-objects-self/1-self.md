# Lesson: Self

## Notes

- When we create a class, each new instance of a class is considered to be an object. An object is a bundle of code that contains both characteristics and behaviors.
- Every object is aware of itself and we can define methods in which we tell objects to operate on themselves.
- We do so by using the `self` keyword, inside the body of an instance method, to refer to the very same object the method is being called on.
- In object-oriented programming, we can encapsulate attributes and behaviors into one object. Instead of writing a method that is not associated to any particular object and that takes in certain objects as arguments, we can insert the method into our class as an instance method.
- The practice of adding methods to or altering Ruby's built in classes is called monkey patching.

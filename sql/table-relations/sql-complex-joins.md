# Lesson: SQL Complex Joins

## Notes

- A complex join in SQL is also referred to as an outer join.
  - An inner join only returns the rows from the database that match the query, whereas outer joins all matching rows and all additional rows from the specified table. Which table/additional rows are determined by the type of outer join.
- There are three types of outer joins: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join
  - The left outer join is the most common outer join. This returns the normal inner join result and also returns all of the rows from the left-most (first mentioned) table.
  - The right outer join returns the normal inner join result and also returns all of the rows from the right-most (last mentioned) table.
  - The full outer join returns all of the rows from all the tables.

# While and Until Loops

- The `while` construct will keep executing a block as long as a specific condition is `true`.
  - Good to use with a counter.
- `until` is simply the inverse of a `while` loop. An `until` keyword will keep executing a block until a specific condition is `true`.
  - The block of code following `until` will execute while the condition is `false`.

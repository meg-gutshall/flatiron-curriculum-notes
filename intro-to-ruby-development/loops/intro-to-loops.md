# Lesson: Intro to Loops

## Notes

- Loops allow us to tell our program to do the same thing over and over with just a few simple, clear, and easy to understand lines.
- Loops have three advantages:
  - First, we are able to achieve results with far fewer lines of code.
  - Secondly, it eliminates the room for error that manual typing allows.
  - Lastly, it clearly conveys to the reader exactly what it will accomplish.

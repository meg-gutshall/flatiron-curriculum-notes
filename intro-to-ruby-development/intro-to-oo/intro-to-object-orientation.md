# Lesson: Intro to Object Orientation

## Notes

- OOP = object-oriented programming

>> Object orientation provides an abstraction of the data on which you operate; moreover, it provides a concrete grouping between the data and the operations you can perform with the dataâ€”in effect giving the data behavior.
>>
- OOP works to bundle data as well as functions that can be performed on that data, or methods.
- An object in code is a thing with all the data and all the logic required to complete a task. Objects are models and metaphors for the problems we solve in code.

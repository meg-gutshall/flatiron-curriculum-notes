# Lesson: Procedural vs Object Oriented Ruby

## Notes

- In procedural programming, data and procedures (or instructions) are two separate things.
- In object-oriented programming, we have units of code that contain both data and instructions, such that an "object" operates on its own data structure.
- An object-oriented approach does not require arguments and instead relies on the internal state of the object.
  - Makes it more organized and easier to understand as well as accommodates for future additions to the program.

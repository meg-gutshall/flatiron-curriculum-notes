# Lesson: About Variable Assignment

## Notes

- Variables are words or characters that store information.
  - Can be almost any type of value (numbers, strings, arrays, and hashes)
- Snake case is the convention in Ruby where variables are separated by underscores.
  - `this_is_an_example`
- Variables should start with a lowercase letter.
  - A variable that begins with an uppercase letter is known as a constant and has different characteristics.
- A Ruby variable cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.
- Ruby is a dynamically typed language, which means that the value of a variable can change its type and does not need to be explicitly and permanently defined.
  - It is also a strongly typed language, which means the variable will not change its type unless you specifically tell it to.
- Variables are assigned values using = ("equal sign"), called the assignment operator.
- Reassign a variable the same way you would assign a variable.
- A “pass-by-value” is when a variable makes a copy of the value it holds and passes the copy over to something else that alters or changes it.
- A “pass-by-reference” changes the actual value that is stored in the variable itself.

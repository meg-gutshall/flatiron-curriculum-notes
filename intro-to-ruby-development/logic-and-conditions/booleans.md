# Lesson: Booleans

## Notes

- Every appearance, or instance, of `true` in a Ruby program is an instance of `TrueClass`, while every appearance of `false` is an instance of `FalseClass`.

### Boolean operators include:

- A `!` ("single-bang") represents "not". This operator reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is `true`, then `!` will make it `false`; if it is `false`, then `!` will make it `true`.
- A `&&` ("double-ampersand") represents "and". To evaluate to `true`, both values of either side of the symbol must evaluate to `true`.
- A `||` ("double-pipe") represents "or". To evaluate to `true`, only one value on either side of the symbol must evaluate to `true`.
- A `==` ("double-equal-sign") checks if the two values are equal. If two values are equal, then the statement will return `true`. If they are not equal, then it will return `false`.

# Lesson: Intro to IRB

## Notes

- IRB stands for “Interactive Ruby”.
- It's a Ruby shell, or REPL, which stands for read–eval–print loop.
- IRB is for testing and manipulating your code. It is only temporary and will not save any code.
- To access IRB, just type `irb` in the terminal.
- To leave IRB, type the `exit` command and you’ll be back in command line.

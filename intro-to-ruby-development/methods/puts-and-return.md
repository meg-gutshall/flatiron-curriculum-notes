# Lesson: Puts and Return

## Notes

- By default, Ruby doesnâ€™t display any output but does return a value for every method.
- The `puts` (short for "out*_put s_*tring") and `print` commands are both used to display in the console the results of evaluating Ruby code. The primary difference between them is that `puts` adds a new line after executing, and `print` does not.
- What methods like `puts` and `print` allow us to output to the console is different from Ruby's concept of a return value, which will be the value of the last statement in the method.
  - The return value of `puts` and `print` is always `nil`.

# Lesson: What Is A Program?

## Notes

All programs are just files on your computer filled with text. That text has a special syntax we call code. The programming language you're using defines the syntax of the code you are allowed to write. Programs are converted to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) so that the computer can understand it.

- Programs can be either interpreted or compiled:
  - [Compiled languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) are converted to machine code before they can be run
  - [Interpreted languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) are converted to machine code at run time
- Every word and character in a program has to be valid code for the Ruby language. It can be one of three things or else an error is thrown.
- A Ruby keyword, something that's part of the ruby language
- Literal data, things like "Strings" and numbers like 1 or 2
- Barewords you define and create, things like variables and methods

# Lesson: Intro to MVC

## Notes

- The Modelâ€“View-Controller paradigm is a popular way of building frameworks for web applications because it provides a separation of concerns where groups of files have specific jobs and interact with each other in very defined ways.
  - Models: The 'logic' of a web application. This is where data is manipulated and/or saved.
  - Views: The 'front-end' user-facing part of a web application. This is the only part of the app that the user interacts with directly. Views generally consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Controllers: The go-between for models and views. The controller relays data from the browser to the application, and from the application to the browser.
